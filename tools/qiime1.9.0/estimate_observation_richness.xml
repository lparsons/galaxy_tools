This script provides estimates of the observation (e.g., OTU) richness (i.e.
number of observations) given a sampling depth (i.e. number of
individuals/sequences per sample). Estimators are provided for both
interpolation/rarefaction and extrapolation.

Interpolation/rarefaction applies when the richness is estimated for a
*smaller* number of individuals than the original number of individuals in that
sample. We refer to this original sampling depth as the &quot;reference sampling
depth&quot; or &quot;reference sample size&quot;.

Extrapolation applies when the richness is estimated for a *larger* number of
individuals than the reference sample size.

This script currently only provides a single unified estimation model for
interpolation and extrapolation. This model is the individual-based multinomial
model, which uses Chao1 to estimate the full richness of the sample. Please
refer to Colwell et al. (2012) for more details; equations 4, 5, 9, 10, 15a,
and 15b are used in this script.

For each interpolation/extrapolation point, the estimate, its unconditional
standard error, and confidence interval are reported. The script currently only
outputs this information to a table, which can be easily viewed in a program
such as Excel. Other output formats, such as plots, may be added in the future.

If an estimate is reported as &quot;N/A&quot;, not enough information was present to
compute an estimate. This can occur when extrapolating if a sample does not
contain any singletons or doubletons, or if there is exactly one singleton and
no doubletons. A singleton is defined as an observation with exactly one
individual/sequence in the sample. A doubleton is defined as an observation
with exactly two individuals/sequences in the sample.

IMPORTANT: If you use the results of this script in any published works, please
be sure to cite the Colwell et al. (2012) paper, as well as QIIME (see
http://qiime.org for details).

In addition to Colwell et al. (2012), the following resources were extremely
useful while implementing and testing these estimators, so it is appropriate to
